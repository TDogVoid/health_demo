# Health_DEMO

This is <strong>Unmaintained</strong>

I'm making this available as an example not intended for use.

This is a small app I created for someone to help track their glucose and blood pressure. Frontend is not pretty but functional as this information needs to be printed it wasn't worth making super pretty.  It's only attended for one user so create account is only accessible when not in prod env. Accounts have to be created manually on prod side.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
